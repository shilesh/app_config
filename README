AppConfig
=========

	Summary:
	=======
		This plugin helps to load values from a config file(yml) file based on the environment, with out writing 
extra code. ie: if you have a config file as 'app_config.yml' and has values in it as title: 'Caption'.The plugin helps you 
to call as "AppConfig::TITLE". If your config file name is 'ror_values.yml' then the values can be accessed as 
RorValue::TITLE". In short <FileName>::<key in caps>.
		I have tested against ruby 1.9 and rails 3.0

	How to use:
	==========
		Install the plugin. 
		This will create a folder 'app_config' inside 'config' folder of your rails application. 
		A mock config file, named 'app_config.yml', will be created with sample data. 
		User can edit the file with proper values. 
		The file name can be renamed
		Based on the file name the namescope will be created to access the values( <FileName>::<KEY> ).
		Restart the server if you change the file name. 
		You can expect helpfull error messages being raised on invalid access.
		When you uninstall the files in config/app_config/* will be retained, expecting that it 
would contain usefull data. You can manually 	delete it if needed.

  Install:
    rails plugin install git://github.com/shilesh/app_config.git

Example
=======

  config/app_config/app_config.yml

  development:
    admin_mail: admin@example.com
    thirdparty_api: dev.sample.com
  production:
    admin_mail: admin@example.com
    thirdparty_api: sample.com

from the application you can access the values(based on environment) as <FileName>::<key in caps>
  ex: AppConfig::ADMIN_MAIL
